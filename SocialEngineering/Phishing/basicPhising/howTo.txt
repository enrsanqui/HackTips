Basic tutorial to phishing with Facebook
-----------------------------------------
1) Create a hosting:
	- Recommended: T35 but it's not free!
	- Tried in another free hosting and it works, though
	  this isn't a big problem once we find a hosting.
2) Go to facebook login page
3) View source code and copy it.
4) Paste it in a index.php file
5) Change "method=post"  to "method=get" and "action=login.php"
to "action=log.php"
6) Use the log.php file allocated within this folder
7) Upload both files to the hosting
8) Send the url to the victim.  

Be carefull because once logged, victim is redirected to the
real login page and a warning is through.
