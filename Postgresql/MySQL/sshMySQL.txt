SSH on MySQL
---------------

1) Generate key

   >> ssh-keygen

2) Connect by ssh to mysql server

   >> ssh -L:3316:127.0.0.1:3309 testdb@172.20.10.7

   -> This tells to connect by ssh and listen in the port 3316 of the host 127.0.0.1 to the 3309 port with the user testdb at the IP 172.20.10.7

3) Now we can use it
