CREATE LINKS TO THE FILES
-------------------------

1) Two types of links:

   - Hard link, exactly the same file size and properties. They have to be in the same file system

   - Soft link: it's a symbolic link and it's like a pointer.

2) Commands:

   >> ln [current_file] [new_link]
   >> ln msfconsole metasploit
   >> ln -s [current_file] [new_link]
